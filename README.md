# Report App
* The project is deployed by [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Live app: [report-app](https://ashvinikumar.github.io/report-app/)

This project is developed using Reactjs.

Here are the steps which I followed during the development.

  - `create-react-app` is used to create the boilerplate of the app
  - `form data` flows from `App` to `report Component`
  - created ```report component``` to display the results enterd by the user
  - [react-dates](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates) used to take date inputs
    - End Date > Start Date 
  - [recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts) used to create graph of intered value
    - Allowed value is from 1 to 100, default value is 1
